/**
 * <p>
 * Multi-purpose annotation used by {@link ConfigurationBeanPostProcessor} to apply configuration based post processing
 * to container managed beans.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following table identifies the purpose of this annotation when used in a given context.
 * </p>
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Target</th>
 * <th>Purpose</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Type</td>
 * <td>When applied at the class level, it identifies the given type as requiring configuration. This is an optimisation
 * that allows the configuration bean post processor to completely ignore beans that do not require configuration. In
 * this context the value does nothing.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Field</td>
 * <td>Identifies a field as needing to be configured. The value of the annotation is an optional expression that
 * identifies what configuration value should be injected. If the type of the field is unique within the configuration,
 * or the field is a {@link List}, then it is not necessary to include an expression.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Method</td>
 * <td>Identifies a bean setter method as needing to be configured. Setter based configuration should be used when a
 * security model prevents field injection. The method must have a single parameter, and no return type. The value of
 * the annotation is an optional expression that identifies what configuration value should be injected. If the type of
 * the method is unique within the configuration, or the field is a {@link List}, then it is not necessary to include an
 * expression.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Parameter</td>
 * <td>Can be used on the parameters of configuration listener methods (those annotated with
 * {@link ConfigurationListener}), to identify a parameter as a configuration value that needs to be resolved. Otherwise
 * behaves just like a field declaration, supporting list types and expressions.</td>
 * </tr>
